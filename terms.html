            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-ngo-blueblack mb-3">1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p class="text-sm text-ngo-dark-gray mb-4">By accessing or using the Flog Ride application ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-ngo-blueblack mb-3">2. Service Description</h2>
            <p class="text-sm text-ngo-dark-gray mb-4">Flog Ride provides a platform to connect NGO staff with transportation and accommodation providers. We are not a transportation or accommodation provider ourselves. The quality of the transport or accommodation services is the responsibility of the third-party provider.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-ngo-blueblack mb-3">3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p class="text-sm text-ngo-dark-gray mb-4">When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-ngo-blueblack mb-3">4. Payments and Fares</h2>
            <p class="text-sm text-ngo-dark-gray mb-4">Users agree to pay all applicable fees for services as described in the app. Fares for transportation are estimates and final charges may vary. Payment terms for drivers and NGOs are outlined separately.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-ngo-blueblack mb-3">5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p class="text-sm text-ngo-dark-gray mb-4">In no event shall Flog Ride, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-ngo-dark-gray mt-6"><em>This is a mock terms of service. For a real application, consult with a legal professional.</em></p>
